# dsh-TUI

> An interactive terminal UI plugin for DeepSeek Harness. It ships a
> pixel-whale header, live work status, streaming thinking, double-Esc time
> rewind, a context progress bar, and a TPS gauge. It mounts as a pure plugin,
> with no core changes. Install to enable; uninstall leaves no patches behind.

## About this fork

This is a personally maintained, independently evolved fork of
[ccch1mneyyy/dsh-TUI](https://github.com/ccch1mneyyy/dsh-TUI). Upstream
features remain intact; everything below is this line's own work.

**Background.** People say that if you cannot build your own agent in 300
lines of code, you do not really know how to use agents. But when you
actually read the source of mature agents — grok, opencode, zcode — the code
volume is not even in the same order of magnitude. Every agent's
architecture, details, and experience differ, and orchestration feel is
deeply subjective. pi builds an agent the minimalist way, and minimalism
does not imply a good experience. After comparing a batch of mainstream
agents, grok became my favorite interaction and dsh my favorite
architecture. Hence this project: **the grok interaction and visualization
recreated on dsh's everything-is-a-plugin architecture, with claude code's
key bindings mixed in**.

The original fork's structure and module split fought my productivity hard,
so a large share of the work went into adaptive refactoring: the main
screen broke out of its monolith into 21 focused modules (hooks, panels,
key orchestration), and the test rig converged into 341 layered gates
(with all 30 historical known-fail entries cleared at the root cause, not
waived). That investment paid for itself in visibly faster iteration
afterwards.

The project was built in the limited hours after work — 40% of this line's
92 commits landed between midnight and 6 a.m.; the commit history is the
receipt. Energy is limited, so **this fork is maintained on a best-effort
basis**. Forks welcome.

**Method: a controlled vibe-coding experiment.** I have always been against
vibe coding: in serious programming, direction, architecture, and
acceptance criteria must be strictly human-reviewed, and that line has not
moved. The granularity of agent feedback this project surfaces — tool
cards, settlement rows, the live thinking tail, the task center — is itself
a product of that preference: I want to watch the agent work, not open a
blind box. It is also why I left claude code after more than a year and a
half: its opacity and its often-awkward task scheduling confirmed that it
was not the experience I wanted.

This project happened to be a valid test field for the opposite approach:
a non-serious testbed with no token budget cap. I planned with
nothing but engineering taste, a feel for test-case decomposition, and a
long-term-maintenance sense, handed implementation to agents, and leaned
on multi-agent / multi-role / multi-model cross-review — precisely the
"wish machine" behavior I had always objected to, this time driven by
intuition from a project-management and acceptance standpoint, with the
results observed. The observation so far: as model capability rises and
agent orchestration stabilizes, the total cost of the wish machine, on
non-serious tasks, may genuinely fall below that of hands-on maintenance.
The conclusion does not extrapolate — for serious work, I still sit on
the review seat.

**Why down to the event loop.** When people talk about harnesses, the
attention lands on skills, MCP, other people's open-sourced workflows,
and plugins — few know how an agent's event loop is actually implemented,
and fewer still tune it to personal taste. That is genuinely harder than
plug-and-play: you have to read the kernel's scheduling, settlement, and
rendering paths before you have standing to speak of "preference". This
project is the homework for that course.

One more observation, about noise: the feed keeps serving whatever the
traffic prefers, yet most of it lacks real engineering practice — it is
anxiety manufacturing and attention farming. Real experience has to be
tried yourself; in the AI era, judgment cannot be outsourced. **Your
life trajectory is your model's training trajectory — its weights are
continuous and self-consistent.** No universal prompt bypasses your
training to upgrade the model of your thinking.

**What this line adds** (over upstream):

| Area | What |
|---|---|
| Unified task center | Ctrl+G panel classifying jobs + subagents: transcript detail, agent strip, vim keys (j/k/g/G, PgUp/PgDn) |
| Grok-style tool-call blocks | Intent titles, fold rows, zero-gap fallback, step-level narration titles |
| Live thinking tail | The working line streams the reasoning tail + bare thinking flow |
| bg_task job cards | Grok-shaped cards, three-tier ack gating, eviction memory, structured stopReason settlement |
| Subagent management | Follow-up composer, status chips, settle toasts, multi-parent docking |
| Selection mode | Global Ctrl+C interrupt, Ctrl+F/B paging, markdown detail cards, full expand semantics |
| /migrate | Multi-source SQLite→JSONL session migration with dry-run |
| Engineering | 341 layered gates (t0/t1/t2 cascade), watch mode, single-source CHANNEL_UI codegen |

## Highlights

- **Pixel whale pet** — three startup intros, click to wake; freezes after the first task.
- **Terminal-native UI** — streaming Markdown, tool cards, `/` and `@` completion, `#L12-14` ranges, history search, zh/en UI.
- **Images** — Kitty/Sixel thumbnails, centered preview with zoom and pan, paste-time fitting, text fallback.
- **Mermaid diagrams** — ````mermaid ```` fences drawn as Unicode diagrams.
- **LaTeX math** — `$…$` and `$$…$$` formulas as Unicode text, fractions and limits stacked in display blocks; `mathRendering: image` typesets block and one-row inline formulas as terminal images on graphics terminals.
- **Timeline rail** — every turn clickable; timeline / scrollbar / hidden gutter.
- **Live state** — activity animation, context bar, TPS, cache hit rate, effort, tokens, session cost estimate (main + subagents), Git and session metadata.
- **One session manager** — `/resume` `/home` `/agentview` `/bg` `⌸`.
- **Session workflow** — `/new` `/compact` `/export` `/btw`, model hot-switch, fork, rewind, vim, fullscreen draft editor.
- **IDE selection channel** — a VS Code selection lands in the prompt.
- **DSH integrations** — presets, skills, MCP, goals, todos, subagents, questionnaires.
- **Account sign-in** — the standard profile offers pi-ai OAuth for ChatGPT/Codex, Claude, and Grok (plus OpenAI direct and Meta Muse when available), and Host-owned DeepSeek browser sign-in as `deepseek-account` on DSH 0.2.0-rc.1+. Use `/provider` or `/auth` without another plugin.
  A profile-only update from a global TUI patch that already mounts `dsh-tui-auth` can still start the official loopback callback listener on demand; fixed-port SSH forwarding still requires the global package to be aligned.
- **Extensions** — browser interaction, computer use and more.
- **Built for long sessions** — event-driven projection, virtualization, bounded caches.

## Quick Start

Prerequisites: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and
[deepseek-harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness).
The `deepseek-official` API-key route needs `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`. On DSH
0.2.0-rc.1+, the standard profile can instead use `/auth login deepseek-account`
and select the separate account route through `/model`. Other supported
accounts can sign in through `/provider` or `/auth` after startup.

This source checkout's primary compatibility target is DSH `0.2.1-rc.2`. This adapter supports its
Shell API, V4 session messages, declarative presets, and profile-backed settings;
older supported hosts retain their compatibility paths. See [configuration](docs/configuration.en.md).

The installer scripts and manual three-step route below use the published
elevenfund `v0.12.0-e1` artifact, paired with DSH `0.2.0-rc.2`. That old tarball
does not contain this checkout's `0.2.1-rc.2` compatibility and migration fixes;
upgrading only its engine cannot supply them. No new artifact is released here.
To verify the source target, follow the [source verification skill](.agents/skills/verify/SKILL.md)
to build and run the actual packed checkout in an isolated profile. Do not
substitute the old release tarball or overwrite your everyday CLI/profile.

On DSH 0.1.7, `/settings` uses the TUI's actual Loader entry ID, including custom
IDs. It requires matching profile dependencies with `@deepseek-ai/schemastery`
3.18.3 or newer; an incompatible schema stops TUI startup with repair guidance
instead of showing an uneditable settings page. Older hosts keep their legacy settings scope.

```sh
# Published install: DSH 0.2.0-rc.2 + v0.12.0-e1 TUI + profile (not the source target)
# Windows (PowerShell)
irm https://github.com/elevenfund/dsh-TUI/releases/download/v0.12.0-e1/install.ps1 | iex
# macOS / Linux
curl -fsSL https://github.com/elevenfund/dsh-TUI/releases/download/v0.12.0-e1/install.sh | bash

# Start
dsh-tui
# Both `dsh-tui` and the short `dst` alias start the same TUI.
dst
```

> **Why the installer script**: this fork shares its name and version with
> the upstream npm package (`@deepseek-harness-tui/dsh-tui@0.12.0`). With a
> bare `npm install -g`, the first profile initialization pulls the
> **upstream** build from the registry, and npm may nest stale engine-line
> dependencies inside the TUI package, breaking module loading. The script
> installs the pinned engine plus this fork, strips those nested copies, and
> pins the profile dependency and package body to this fork's release tarball
> (so `/update` never drifts back to the registry build).

Manual installation of the published release (the same three steps as the script):

```sh
npm install -g @deepseek-ai/dsh@0.2.0-rc.2 https://github.com/elevenfund/dsh-TUI/releases/download/v0.12.0-e1/elevenfund-dsh-tui-0.12.0.tgz
```

Then remove the nested `node_modules/@deepseek-ai` inside the TUI package and
point the profile (`~/.dsh/profiles/dsh-tui`) dependency and package body at
that same tarball. The upstream registry build is a different distribution;
it is not a substitute for verifying this checkout's compatibility fixes either.

> **New-user note**: pnpm ≥11 blocks dependencies with install scripts by
> default and reports `ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS`. Updates skip foreign-platform
> `@img/sharp-*` native packages, saving about 200MB of downloads. `/update`
> and `dsh-tui update` write both settings automatically. No manual step
> needed. Details:
> [Getting started](docs/getting-started.en.md#pnpm-install-script-blocks-and-foreign-platform-natives).

After startup the TUI checks for newer versions in the background. It never
blocks the first frame. Type `/update` for a one-shot upgrade. It restarts
automatically and resumes the current session. See
[Getting started](docs/getting-started.en.md) for the profile lifecycle,
source builds, and troubleshooting, including migration from the former
`dsh-cc-tui` package.

### CLI

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `dsh-tui` / `dst` | Start the TUI; `dst` is a short alias for the same program |
| `dsh-tui --resume [id]` · `dsh-tui update` · `dsh-tui doctor` | Resume a session · update the profile and align the launcher · pre-flight environment checks |
| `dsh-tui safe` | Read-only diagnostics, plugin inventory and repair guidance; `safe --rescue` builds a clean rescue profile |
| `dsh-tui version` · `dsh-tui help` | Launcher and profile versions and usage; both work even without a `dsh` install |

Leading DSH options such as `--dump-config` and `--patch <path>` are forwarded
unchanged; other arguments go to the app in `dsh --profile dsh-tui`. Use
`dsh-tui -- --resume=sid-1 ./notes` to send `--resume=sid-1 ./notes` as literal
prompt text, without selecting a session or workspace. When invoking DSH
directly, use `dsh --profile dsh-tui -- -- --resume=sid-1 ./notes`: the first
`--` belongs to DSH, the second to the app. Host options can precede a literal
prompt: `dsh-tui --patch ./overlay.yml -- --resume=sid-1` applies the overlay
and sends `--resume=sid-1` as prompt text without resuming that session.
Safe mode: [Getting started](docs/getting-started.en.md).

### Importing conversations from other agents (`dsh-tui migrate`)

Bring Claude Code, Codex, OMP, zcode, or Grok Build conversation histories into the DSH session store, then browse and resume them by their original working directory via `/resume`:

```sh
dsh-tui migrate                # list importable counts per agent (writes nothing)
dsh-tui migrate claude-code    # import every Claude Code conversation (likewise codex / omp / zcode / grok-build)
dsh-tui migrate codex --dry-run  # preview what would land, write nothing
```

- **Read-only source**: migration only reads the foreign agent's local store; artifacts are written through the official `JsonlSessionPersistence` backend, so imported sessions are first-class (openable, continuable).
- **Idempotent**: one deterministic UUID per source conversation — re-importing skips what is already present instead of stacking duplicates.
- **Structure preserved**: user/assistant messages, reasoning traces, tool calls with their results, and the source's context compactions (as native compaction checkpoints) are rebuilt turn by turn; harness-injected machine text opens no turn. An imported session can pick the work straight up.
In-TUI browsing: the session screen (`/resume`) shows a tab per agent that has conversations; picking one imports just that conversation and opens it.
In-TUI: `/migrate` (optionally `/migrate <agent> [--dry-run]`) runs the same import in a child process and reports through the notification flow.
CLI alternative: `dsh-tui migrate ...` from any shell runs the same import.
Full guide: [Session migration](docs/migrate.en.md).

- More agents (pi, opencode, …) extend the adapter registry as adapters land; grok-build reads `GROK_HOME` when set.

**VS Code**: use the integrated terminal or the `dsh-tui-vscode` extension. See [VS Code guide](docs/vscode.en.md). **Herdr**: run `dsh-tui` in a [Herdr](https://herdr.dev) pane; `idle` / `working` / `blocked` are reported through its local integration API.

## Context Hint (recovery cards)

Off by default. `/hint enable` discloses the destination and selected content,
then requests only this component's own local-storage read/write permissions.
Enabling makes no model call. Each future settled human interaction permits
at most one automatic request with the current main provider/model; tool steps,
streamed tokens and repaint never multiply it. `/hint refresh` also generates
cards manually, inheriting the current provider/model by default or an
independently selected Summary Model. Failed/cancelled turns stay truthful.
Cards are display-only: never appended to the transcript or main-model context.
Use `/hint view` or default `Alt+O` to expand/collapse, `Esc` to return without
losing the draft. `/hint disable` cancels pending work but retains saved cards.
Re-enabling after a disabled restart restores applicable cards without a summary call.
`/hint pause` persists project pause and blocks new automatic requests, leaving
already started valid work alone. `/hint refresh` / `retry` remain explicit
single attempts while paused. `/hint resume` handles future interactions only,
not paused backlog or a turn already open at resume. Opening/restoring/navigating
never generates hints. Enabled hints (including pause) temporarily suppress old
automatic recap and cancel pending auto recap; manual `/recap` remains available.
Disable restores the previously effective preference without writing `recapOnOpen`.

`/hint model` opens a select dialog with the current Summary Model and host catalog
(first 99 entries); use arrows/Enter to choose.
Use `/hint model provider/model` for an independent choice, or `/hint model inherit`
for per-request inheritance. Enable first for own-storage consent. Saving requires
destination/content disclosure again; cancelling leaves the choice unchanged.
Only the route preference is saved in this component's namespace for the current
TUI data home, surviving restart. No credentials are copied and the main session
model never changes. Saving generates nothing and cancels old in-flight results.
If a saved destination disappears or its configuration becomes invalid, refresh
fails explicitly without fallback, retaining any applicable Last Valid card.
After revoked storage grants, re-enabling first grants only own-storage read
access to inspect the retained choice. A different actual destination must be
accepted before write access and generation are enabled. Cancellation, failed
writes or interruption before that consent cannot restore an unaccepted route
on restart; read-only access may remain, without changing the old cards.

Set `contextHintShortcut: alt+p` in the `dsh-tui` config, or set
`DSH_TUI_HINT_SHORTCUT=alt+p`. Explicit config wins; an empty string disables
the key, preserving `/hint view`. Reserved keys, user-remapped built-ins and
modals take priority; use the command on conflict.

Each request selects at most 12,000 input characters of recent human,
assistant and tool text plus actual turn outcomes, without the original system
prompt, tool definitions or whole session log. Local output accumulation is
limited to 16,000 characters including reasoning, with 2,048 output tokens
requested and a 15-second deadline. These are not a spending guarantee or a
universal remote token cap. There is no automatic repair/retry. Failure retains
the Last Valid card with a marker; `/hint retry` explicitly makes one new request.
Built-in Codex OAuth summaries use the same registered adapter with a
request-local SSE snapshot to avoid hidden WebSocket retries, leaving main
configuration unchanged. An unacknowledged Codex owner fails explicitly without
switching models. Internal network behavior of arbitrary custom adapters is
not universally guaranteed.

The same summary may propose a Project Suggestion. Generation/opening never
confirms it. `/hint project review` shows the current confirmed card and full
proposed replacement; close detail, then explicitly `/hint project confirm` to
save or `/hint project reject` to leave shared content unchanged. Empty confirmed
state is shown honestly. Linked worktrees reload the same confirmed goal,
constraints and decisions when reopening; Session/Turn remain session-owned.
Intervening confirmation/control changes produce a visible conflict without a
write. Review again, then explicitly confirm or reject; no silent rebase/merge.
Pending suggestions are session-local memory, cleared on refresh, switching,
disable or restart, not persisted.

Only Summary Model choice, current project opt-in/pause controls, latest confirmed Project and per-session cards persist: no additional raw
prompt/tool-output or generation-history archive. Summaries may be sensitive
and storage is not claimed to be encrypted. Linked Git worktrees share project
identity; separate clones do not. Project lifetime is independent of a session.
Concurrency uses a cooperative single-host PID lock with normal admitted storage;
it does not protect against older uncooperative writers, guarantee network-file-
system/power-loss durability, or provide live push updates. Reopen to reload.
Deletion controls
remain in subsequent tickets.

## Keybindings & Mouse

`Enter` send · `Tab` complete · `Ctrl+Enter` interrupt and send · `Alt+Up` recall the last message · `Esc` dismiss, double-`Esc` rewinds · `Ctrl+O` details · `Ctrl+R` history · `Ctrl+V` paste · `Ctrl+Shift+E` fullscreen draft editor · `?` shortcuts · `←` background the session.

While the model is working: `Enter` steers, `Tab` queues a follow-up, `Ctrl+Enter` interrupts and sends.

Browsing the transcript: `Shift+Up` or idle `Tab` enters selection mode — `k/j` move the cursor, `l/h` expand/collapse, `Enter` opens the detail card, `g/G` jump to either end, `Ctrl+F/B` page, `Ctrl+C` interrupts from anywhere.

Subagents & tasks: `Ctrl+G` opens the task center — background jobs and subagents classified on one screen; `↑/↓/j/k` move (vim), `g`/`G` jump to the first/last row, `PgUp`/`PgDn` page the focus by half a viewport, `Enter` reads a subagent's full conversation transcript, `m` follows up (running ones steer, idle ones cold-resume), `x` stops the focused running row (job kill / subagent interrupt), `d` drops a settled subagent from the list (persisted). A live one-line strip under the input shows every running item; clicking a strip line opens that transcript, and `Esc` returns where you came from (the panel or the main session). `Ctrl+A` keeps the subagent dashboard; external editor moved to `alt+g`.

On native Windows, fragmented Win32 input records are reassembled across short input delays instead of appearing as numeric protocol text. The platform check only reports that this machine might run the private mode (win32-input-mode); a bare `ESC[` fragment is held only after one record has actually been decoded, while a fragment whose own shape is already record-specific holds on its own (which is how even the first record can survive a split). Windows terminals that never enter the mode (mintty, GitBash) therefore keep the classic VT path: a lone `Esc` keeps its normal response time, and a letter typed after a timed-out `ESC[` is not swallowed.

Incomplete records are held for a bounded recovery window (1 second from first capture, never extended by later input; 64 bytes max); past either bound the hold ends and input is handled as before. Unrecognized complete CSI sequences are not inserted as text; after a damaged CSI prefix, a bare ASCII letter can be consumed as its terminator, while normal Win32 key records and bracketed-paste text retain their own boundaries.

A session's very first record can still leave residue if it is split before its record-specific shape forms; once any record has been decoded, every split position is covered. Inside the recovery window, literal input starting with `[digit;…` cannot be told apart from a protocol prefix — it may be held, or re-joined to a preceding `Esc`. To type it, wait for the window to close, or avoid that shape right after `Esc`.

Terminal replies that arrive split are reassembled the same way (native Windows ConPTY is the common source): while the app still has a query awaiting its answer, an unfinished DA1 / DA2 / DSR / DECRPM / XTVERSION tail — even one split again after the introducer `Esc` was flushed — is held across input delays, but only while its shape can still complete into the response type that query expects. It is then consumed as the reply it completes instead of entering the prompt as protocol text.

That claim is evidence-gated, and this is the difference from earlier builds: no query awaiting an answer means nothing is claimed, so a literal `[?61;4c` typed right after `Esc` still enters the prompt exactly as before.

The window is bounded like the record hold (about a second, never extended by later input; 64 bytes max); past either bound it ends, and bytes still shaped like an unfinished reply prefix are dropped rather than shown.

Inside that window, with a query of the matching response type outstanding, same-shaped literal input can still be claimed as a reply; to type it, wait for the window to close (about a second), or avoid that shape while a query is outstanding.

Mouse (fullscreen): drag to select and copy, double/triple click to select a word or line, click tool cards, timeline ticks and `[Image #N]` previews.

**Pasting**: native and bracketed paste keeps ordinary text and newlines, and never submits itself on arrival. On Windows terminals that deliver a paste as win32-input-mode key records, the residue is stripped at the entry point (a multi-line paste no longer leaves stray `_`) and pasted CRLF collapses to a single newline; genuine underscores and bracketed-paste text are untouched.

**Dropped files**: a native Windows desktop drop (Windows Terminal / OpenConsole) arrives as an OSC 8 hyperlink; the parser restores its `file://` URI to a decoded local path before paste hygiene runs, so the `]8;id=…;` parameter bytes never reach the draft. Image paths enter the existing image staging pipeline; other files are inserted as a referenceable path (a path containing whitespace arrives in the composer's quoted `"…"` single-token form). Only `file://` URIs are restored, and it is fail-closed: a remote authority/UNC, a payload carrying several distinct URIs, or a URI that carries several tokens is refused and stays literal text rather than guessed.

## Built-in Commands

`/resume` · `/home` · `/agentview` · `/bg` · `⌸` open the same session manager: workspace rail, live state, filter, ★ pins. Also `/model` `/new` `/compact` `/export` `/btw` `/tree` `/fork` `/rewind` `/settings` `/status` `/cost` `/jobs` `/skills` `/mcp` `/provider` `/auth` `/login` `/update`.

The session manager paints the last successful list immediately while it checks the persistence store for changes. Titles that require a deeper log scan appear first with a fallback name and update in place when recovery finishes.

**Background sessions**: `/bg` or `←` on an empty prompt; `Esc` returns. They run in this process and stop when the TUI exits. Logs survive.

## Configuration & Extensions

Agent presets, themes, MCP servers, environment variables: [Configuration](docs/configuration.en.md) · [Themes](docs/themes.en.md).

## How It Works

```text
dsh profile → dsh-base → dsh-TUI Cordis patch → agent preset + DSH services
  → session/event → Channel projection → React components → Ink/Yoga renderer → terminal
```

The TUI handles interaction and presentation. The session log is the source of truth. DSH services own models, tools, and persistence. Long sessions render in O(visible window).

Runtime path, module boundaries, performance notes and persistence locations: [Architecture and limitations](docs/architecture.en.md).

## Known Limitations

- Injected plugin context has no standalone display; it counts into the context segments.
- `/model` switches by forking the session; the old session stays in `/resume` (a session nobody has typed into records no branch, so your first prompt there still gets a generated title).
- `Ctrl+V` needs platform clipboard tools; unsupported bitmap formats are rejected.
- A dropped file is restored from its OSC 8 `file://` URI alone: multi-file drops, non-Windows terminal drop encodings and terminator-less truncated frames are not covered, and the hyperlink's own display name is never used.
- A background session lives inside this process and stops when the TUI exits.
- `/thinking` is not persisted; `/compact` is unavailable under the kernel's `minimal` agent preset (极简模式, one persistent-shell tool) — a different thing from the `/settings → Minimal UI` (极简界面) display switch; `/update` needs a `dsh --profile` launch and is refused while a turn is running.
- The status-bar `≈¥` and `/cost` are session estimates that include subagent usage (priced per each agent's model × peak/idle × cache components); unofficial or unlisted models show tokens only and are marked unpriced. **The platform bill is authoritative.**

## Development

CI uses Node 24 and pnpm 11. The package supports Node `^22.19 || >=24`.

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm build

`lib/types/` is ignored generated output. `pnpm build` recompiles it from a
clean output directory and runs the build gates. **Git URL installs are not
supported.** The source manifest keeps `@dsh-std/*` as workspace deps and
`vendor/dsh-std` as a submodule. pnpm ≥11 also refuses git-hosted `prepare`
scripts by default. Install the registry package instead:
`dsh plugin --profile dsh-tui add @deepseek-harness-tui/dsh-tui`. Rendering,
questionnaire, or tool-card changes also need the matching regression scripts.

## Permissions and Security Boundary

> **Windows security warning:** the Windows profile defaults to `danger-full-access` with approval set to `never`, so tools have unrestricted access. Inspect and tighten the profile before starting next to sensitive credentials or in an untrusted repository.

No sandbox of its own: dsh-TUI uses the active DSH profile's filesystem, shell, sandbox and approval policies. Permission presets come from the DSH `permissionPresets` registry.

Details: [Permissions and security boundary](docs/architecture.en.md#permissions-and-security-boundary).

- The pixel whale's 22 hand-drawn frames and its idle behaviors are ported
  from **[dsh-ui-whale](https://github.com/lhh010/dsh-ui-whale)**. The frames
  were drawn cell by cell in Excel. The idle behaviors are fin flutters, tail
  thumps, sleep Z's, and click hearts. dsh-ui-whale is the DeepSeek Harness
